          "fullContent": "Hi everyone! My 5-year-old daughter keeps confusing b and d letters. We've been practicing for weeks but she still mixes them up. I've tried the 'bed' trick where b comes first in the word, but it doesn't seem to stick. Has anyone found effective methods to help children distinguish between these mirror letters? I'm getting a bit worried since she starts kindergarten soon. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Should I encourage her independence even if she's mostly guessing, or should I continue to read with her until she has more skills? I don't want to discourage her enthusiasm, but I also want to make sure she's building real reading skills.",
